# Using React (Hooks) with D3 - Bar Chart with negative values

This is a special variation branch without a video episode attached, as a request for Sam Henderson.
This branch shows how to create a bar chart with D3 / React, where you also have negative values. Unlike the other 04-branch, this bar chart has no animations at the moment.

## Getting Started

`git clone git@github.com:muratkemaldar/using-react-hooks-with-d3.git`

`git checkout 04-bar-chart-negative-values`

`npm install`

`npm start`
